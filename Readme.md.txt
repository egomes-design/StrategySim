# 🚲 VoltCycle: Strategic Evolution Simulation

An interactive business strategy simulation built with Python and Streamlit. This tool is designed for learning purposes, allowing users to lead a bicycle manufacturer through an 8-year growth cycle.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

The simulation integrates three core strategic management frameworks:

1.  **Ansoff’s Matrix**: Navigate growth through Market Penetration, Market Development, Product Development, and Diversification.
2.  **Porter’s Generic Strategies**: Choose between **Cost Leadership** (operational efficiency) and **Differentiation** (brand value and premium features).
3.  **Value Chain Analysis**: Make decisions impacting Procurement, Operations, and Marketing to see how they affect Gross Margins and Cash Flow.

## 🕹️ How the Simulation Works

You are the CEO of **VoltCycle**. You start in Year 1 with a standard mechanical bike and a 12% market share. Over 8 years, you must make one critical strategic choice per year.

### The 4 Phases of Growth:
*   **Years 1-2: Market Penetration** – Focus on the core product and operational efficiency.
*   **Years 3-4: Market & Product Development** – Decide whether to innovate (E-Bikes) or expand geographically (Europe).
*   **Years 5-6: Diversification & Value Chain** – Explore new mobility segments (Scooters) or vertically integrate your supply chain.
*   **Years 7-8: Consolidation & Defense** – Defend your market share against a massive global entrant using Niche Focus or Price Wars.
